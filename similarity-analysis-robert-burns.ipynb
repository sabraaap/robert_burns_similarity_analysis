    "This report provides an analysis of the complete works by Scottish poet Robert Burns (1759-96). More specifically, it investigates the extent of similarity between the works in this corpus using statistical analysis of their structure (number of lines, number of stanzas etc.) and similarity analysis of the content using Machine Learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the relevant data was gathered from www.bbc.co.uk/arts/robertburns using Python web scraping techniques. The data was then, partially in the same step, processed to a usable format for the statistical and similarity analyses. After that, the statistical analysis and visualisation of the data was carried out resulting in descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of features of interest. This was conducted for the full corpus, as well as for the most popular works and other works individually. Subsequently, the text document similarity of the corpus was assessed using several different distance measures. The results of the similarity analyses - in the form of similarity matrices, average similarity scores, and most similar works - were then compared. Taking into account the key findings from the statistical and similarity analysis, final conlusions were drawn as to the degree of similarity between Burns' works, and potential for further work outlined."

    "In order to asses the degree of similarity between Robert Burns' works, access to the full text for as many of his work as possible was quintessential. The chosen data source for this purpose was an area of the BBC website dedicated to the works of Robert Burns (www.bbc.co.uk/arts/robertburns). Not only was this the number one search result for 'robert burns poems list', but full text and audio recordings from more than 700 works were available, many of them associated with the year of composition, day of the year, theme, and a location. Furthermore, the website provided a list of 15 works that the BBC experts classified as 'popular works'. Having all this information on the same domain, with a similar DOM structure, facilitated a streamlined web scraping process and offered much potential for the current analysis and additional analyses in the future. It has to be noted that this may not be the most complete source of Burns' works, nor was the methodology behind the 15 'popular works' revealed so that the results of the analysis may differ when using a different, more comprehensive data source."

    "The data from the BBC website was obtained using web scraping techniques, specifically using the Python libraries requests and bs4 in a reusable function. As a first step, a list of the href's/URL's of the pages containing the full text of the 700+ works was retrieved. Each page was then scraped in turn to retrieve the text which was stored in a dictionary of dictionaries alongside the title. Additionally, further processing of the raw text resulted in a cleaned version of the text, as well as the number of paragraphs, number of lines, number of words, number of letters and average number of lines per paragraph, words per line, and letters per word. The year of composition of the work was stored in the same dictionary, obtained by scraping pages that list the works by year and matching the years with the works in the dictionary. In a similar process, it was established whether a work was listed among the 'popular works'. As a last step, the dictionary with the works and corresponding features was turned into a Pandas DataFrame. The resulting Pandas DataFrame contains 715 observations and 12 features. Out of the 12 features, 7 are of data type integer or float, 4 of string, and 1 of boolean."

    "Machine learning models require arbitrary data like text documents or images to be supplied as numerical features. This process is called feature extraction. The two most commonly used methods for feature extraction from text documents are Count Vectorisation and TF-IDF Vectorisation. Count Vectorization is inherently biased towards more frequent terms as it simply counts the number of times each term appears in a given document. This is called term frequency (TF). TF-IDF Vectorisation, on the other hand, weights the term's frequency with its inverse document frequency (IDF), to reduce the impact of frequent but potentially less interesting words. (6.2. Feature extraction — scikit-learn 0.24.0 documentation, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let TF(t, d) be the term frequency of a given term t in a given document d, n the number of documents in a corpus, and DF(t) the number of documents in the corpus that contain term t. The IDF and consequently the IF-IDF can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$IDF(t) = \\log\\frac{n}{DF(t) + 1}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) * \\log\\frac{n}{DF(t) + 1}$$\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One option to implement this in Python is using Scikit-Learn's CountVectorizer and then TfidfTransformer. However, Scikit-Learn also provides a TfidfVectorizer which computes all required steps at once. This is why in this report, TfidfVectorizer was used to produce the TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case with the Burns' corpus investigated in this report, documents of the same corpus often vary in length. Ladd therefore suggests to \"use the distance measure that disregards differences in magnitude and focuses on the proportions of features\" (Ladd, 2020). Rather than with the exact position of the vectors, cosine similarity is only concerned with their orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another argument in favour of the cosine similarity is presented by Han, who states that due to the nature of term-frequency vectors which often contain sparse numeric data (many 0 values where documents do not share a term), many traditional distance measures, such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance, are not an ideal choice for establishing the similarity between documents. As not sharing words (i.e. having 0 values in common) does not make two (or more) documents similar, the appropriate measure for establishing document similarity in text analysis is one that disregards such 0 matches and focuses on those terms that the documents do have in common. One such  measure is cosine similarity, which was used in this report to compute document similarity. (Han, 2011)\n",
    "\n",
    "When two vectors have no match, the angle between them is 90 degrees (cosine equals 0). Conversely, when two vectors are identical, the angle between them is 0 degrees (cosine equals 1). While cosine similarity represents proximity rather than distance, i.e. the highest value represents the closest proximity, machine learning models compute the cosine distance, where the values are reversed, meaning the lowest value represents the closest proximity. \n",
    "\n",
    "If u and v are two vectors, and θ the angle between the vectors, then the cosine distance is:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$ 1 - \\frac{u \\cdot v}{||u||_2 ||v||_2} $$\n",
    "or <br><br>\n",
    "$$ 1−\\cos(θ) $$ \n",

    "Based on the maximum and minimum of the 'words', 'lines' and 'paragraphs' (stanzas) features, it was established which works are the longest and shorted in this collection of Burns' works, \"The Jolly Beggars : Love and Liberty - A Cantata\" being the longest (with 79 stanzas, 364 lines and 2237 words) and \"Epigram. Another On The Said Occasion\" being the shortest (with 1 stanzas, 2 lines and 7 words). These statistics also represent the range for the features 'words', 'lines' and 'paragraphs'; the works in this corpus range from 1 to 79 stanzas, 2 to 364 lines and 7 to 2237 words, with a mean of 5, 31, and 190, respectively, as well as a median of 4, 21, and 131, respectively. It can be deduced that Burns' works are structurally dissimilar and he did not obviuosly favour a certain form.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is already implied by the fact that the median of all numerical data features is smaller than the mean, the distribution of the data is positively skewed. This was investigated further through exemplary histograms for the 'letters per word', 'words per line', 'lines per paragraph', and 'paragraphs', the first three of which were calculated in order to normalise the shorter and longer works and make them more comparable. The distributions of 'letters per word' and 'words per line', resemble a normal distribution much more closely, in comparison with the distribution of 'lines per paragraph' and 'paragraphs', which are positively skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bar chart of the number of works by composition year shows that majority of the works in this corpus were composed between 1784 and 1796, and that, if this can be considered a representative sample of Burns' works, Burns' most productive year was 1786 (when Burns was aged 27), with 65 works. These numbers coincide with his biography. The fact that the majority of Burns' works were written over a longer period of time may provide some context for interpreting the apparent structural dissimilarity of his works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing his 'popular works' with other works (not listed under popular works on the BBC website) shows that those works that are considered popular are on average longer. However, the standard deviation for the popular works is higher (apart from for the number of paragraphs), indicating a bigger spread of the data points and hence a less homogeneous picture when it comes to the length of these works. While this is an indication that works are not favoured because of their length (or shortness), whether there is a statistically significant relationship between the length of a work by Burns and its popularity or not cannot be ascertained solely from this - further statistical analysis and ideally more data would be required. Moreover, the methodology for including works in the popular works list is not known. Ideally, the classification of works as popular would be based on multiple sources, which was out of scope for this report but could be a possible extension in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the cosine distance matrix, the average cosine distance is 0.9771. Since this number is very near 1, it can be established that on average, the text in the documents examined in this report is quite dissimilar. A more detailed analysis to establish which works have the highest degree of similarity shows that the corpus contains quite a few cases of multiple near identical versions of the same work under different titles, which, in some cases, cannot easily be established from the title (e.g. \"Sketch\" vs. \"Poem on Pastoral Poetry\"). Removing near duplicates of the same work from the corpus and repeating the analysis with the adjusted corpus would ensure that the more informative similarities are being prioritised. The fact that despite the existence of near duplicates, the cosine distance is near 1, only emphasises that Burns' works are lexically diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 12,484 unique words in this corpus of works by Burns, excluding English stop words (as per Scikit-Learn's built-in stop word list). Amongst the most common terms are the nouns 'heart' and 'love'. There is no term (that is not a stop word) and has been used in all works. Scikit-Learn admit to several known issues with their English stop words list and recommend the use of an an alternative to ensure that the results are not affected by these issues. (scipy.spatial.distance.pdist — SciPy v1.5.4 Reference Guide, 2020) One option would be to provide a custom stop words list which would also cover Scots dialect stop words; since Burns wrote his poems in English with a Scots dialect some terms that would be considered stop words remain in the unique words list and result in legitimate (non-stop) words ranking lower in the list when ordered by term frequency. While fine-tuning the stop words approach is out of scope for the current analysis, it should be considered for any future work on this corpus."

    "This analysis of a Robert Burns' corpus containing more than 700 works has shown that Burns didn't favour a certain form or vocabulary, as the works analysed are both structurally and lexically quite dissimilar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Certain constraints and weaknesses have been highlighted which could lead to further work, including a more pluralistic approach to establishing popularity of his works, identifying and removing near duplicate works that were published under different titles, and refining term frequency analysis by accounting for Scots English stop words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a similarity analysis between the works written in the same year could be interesting, as could be an analysis of how form and vocabulary evolved over time. Since most of Burns' works were written to be either sung or read aloud, analysing the available audio files may provide additional insights. The data source provides a theme and location for most works. While the methodology for extracting this was not provided - and it may well have been done manually - it would be interesting to see if an analysis using machine learning techniques to extract the theme would come to the same conclusions. Mapping the locations of Burns' works, potentially against other features such as year or theme, could also provide interesting insights. Lastly, in a further analysis, it could be established what the precentage of non-Scots dialect specific words for each work is."
